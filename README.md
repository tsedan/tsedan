## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tomer Sedan

I'm an undergraduate student at the Pennsylvania State University studying Computer Science.
Feel free to look around!

Here are three projects I'm particularly proud of:
1. [anx](https://github.com/tsedan/anxlang) (LLVM-based C++ compiler for a systems language 'anx')
2. [rubato](https://github.com/rubatopy/rubato) (SDL2 game engine built for Python with Cython)
3. [nur](https://github.com/tsedan/nur) (WebRTC peer-to-peer online brawler)

I can be reached at [tsedan@pm.me](mailto:tsedan@pm.me).
