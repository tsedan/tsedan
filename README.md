## ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tomer Sedan

I'm an undergraduate student at the Pennsylvania State University studying Computer Science.
Feel free to look around!

Here are three projects I'm particularly proud of:
1. [rubato](https://github.com/rubatopy/rubato)
2. [zipper](https://github.com/tsedan/zipper)
3. [nur](https://github.com/tsedan/nur)

I can be reached at [tsedan@pm.me](mailto:tsedan@pm.me).
